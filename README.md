# Docker Multi Host Networking
Nowdays, docker or container is getting darn popular. As a new virtualization technology, it is much more efficient 
and lightweight compared with traditional hypervisors. For any virtualization technology, network is a big headache, 
for docker, of course it is. In this repository, I will try to digg into different docker multi host networking models, 
give brief introduction and make comparison. I am not a network expert, just hope this can be a good reference when 
you come to docker networking.

## Network Models
- Flannel UDP&VxLan
- Weave FDP
- Calico
- Direct Route
- Public IP
- Docker 1.9 Overlay
- OVS VLAN(VxLan)
