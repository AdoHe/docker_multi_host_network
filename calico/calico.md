Project Calico represents a new approach to virtual networking, based on the same scalable IP networking principles 
as the Internet. Unlike other virtual networking approaches, Calico does not use overlays, instead providing a pure 
Layer 3 approach to data center networking. Calico is simple to deploy and diagnose, provides a rich security policy, 
supports both IPv4 and IPv6 and can be used across a combination of bare-metal, VM and container workloads. Steps 
below illustrate how to use Calico to enable multi-host docker network communication.
